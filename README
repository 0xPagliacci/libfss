This is a function secret sharing (FSS) library for Go based the following papers:

- Boyle, Elette, Niv Gilboa, and Yuval Ishai. "Function Secret Sharing: Improvements and Extensions." Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security. ACM, 2016.

- Boyle, Elette, Niv Gilboa, and Yuval Ishai. "Function secret sharing." Annual International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2015. 

This implementation uses the techniques described in: 

Frank Wang, Catherine Yun, Shafi Goldwasser, Vinod Vaikuntanathan, and Matei Zaharia. "Splinter: Practical Private Queries on Public Data." NSDI 2017.

We created a Go library for portability reasons. The main FSS files are in libfss/. Doing a go install on the test/ folder will create the test programs.
